# CS-489-Git-GitHub-Tutorials

Git is the most widely used version control system in the world. A lot of projects both open and closed source rely on Git as a version control system. However, during past years, it has been noticed that most students are not equipped enough with the necessary information and practice in order to use Git. This project is aimed to address this issue in a course such as CS 319 which also forces GitHub usage for its term project. 

By the courtesy of the TA Fatih Sevban Uyanık, a preliminary survey has been done to the students in order to learn their preliminary knowledge. Afterward, a lecture is given on youtube and in the class. In order to evaluate their knowledge, a laboratory assignment has been prepared. After the laboratory assignment, a post-survey has been conducted and the results were compared with the initial survey results and the improvement of the student’s knowledge level has been reflected.
